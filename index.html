                    <div id="right-box"><P>Humans are the most superior creatures amid all the
                         creatures in the entire universe. Being a part of this universe makes me 
                         feel small and minuscule in a world where there is millions of humans 
                         like myself. Although everyone is quite unique in their own way. I try
                          my best to be humble, kind and respectful of everybody I meet regardless 
                          of their age, gender, family background, nationality or race. </p>
                        <p>I am OGUNEKO Omotayo John. I am a Nigerian. 
                            I live in Ogun state, Nigeria. I am twenty-three years old.
                             I am the third of four children. Ours is a close knit family.
                              I have an older brother, an older sister and a younger brother as well. 
                              I love my siblings and my parents dearly and they love too.  </p>
                        <p>I am currently in 400L and also striving to equip myself with some tech skills. I am a focus driven and hardworking which reflects in my grades. I am a certified Electrical technician. My professional aspiration is to obtain a bachelor's degree in any mental health related course at the university, which would promote my career goal of being a mental health practitioner in a military setting. The reason why I want to pursue a degree in the Psychology line is to someday be able to provide a subsidized mental health facility to a magnitude of people in Nigeria. Hence, I study hard because without a degree I cannot attain these goals. I also have the passion to become a Prolific Website technician equipped with enough skills to build websites, software applications, and many other tech programming products that would meet the global standard.</p>
                        <p>Aside my love for everything Psychological,Electrical and Tech related, I love to travel and meet new people. I am an ambivert person and I love to have fun. My live centers on improving humanity and I love where I am at right now.</p>
                        <p>Life is full of ups and downs. I know this is a clich, but this phrase summarizes my whole existence. Sometimes my life is fun, happy and almost enviable and at other times my life is boring, sad, uninspiring and sometimes downright disgusting. I know I am not perfect, I have never tried to be, but one thing is true Â¨ I AM WHO I AM.</p>
                        <p>Looking back at my childhood, I remember the fun times, the laughter we all shared the lavish party my parents threw, my wonderful friends and my fancy dresses. I was the envy of my friends and I erroneously thought my life would follow this pattern forever. Was I ever wrong!</p>
                        <p>I was a good child. I never acted out like I do now. I was always obedient and I had good grades, even if they were not excellent grades. I had a positive outlook towards life. I made a promise to myself never to smoke, do drugs or land myself in the prison for any illegal act. I cared an awful lot about people and I thought nothing would ever change this attitude that I had.</p>
